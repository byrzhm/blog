## Abstract

**1. Background** <br>
Relaxed semantics have been introduced to increase the achievable parallelism of
concurrent data structures in exchange for weakening their ordering semantics.

**2. Contributions** <br>
In this paper, we revisit the balanced allocations d-choice load balancing scheme
in the context of relaxed FIFO queues.

**3. Methods** <br>
Our novel load balancing approach distributes operations evenly across n sub-queues
based on operation counts, achieving low relaxation errors independent on the queues
size, as opposed to similar earlier designs. We prove its relaxation errors to be
of $O(\frac{n\log\log n}{\log d})$ with high probability for a collection of possible
executions. Furthermore, our scheme, contrary to previous ones, manages to interface
and integrate the most performant linearizable queue designs from the literature as components.

**4. Results** <br>
Our resulting relaxed FIFO queue is experimentally shown to outperform the previously
best design using balanced allocations by **more than four times in throughput**, while
simultaneously incurring **less than a thousandth of its relaxation errors**. In a
**concurrent breadth-first-search benchmark**, our queue consistently outperforms both
relaxed and strict state-of-the-art FIFO queues.
