- [How to Use Disown Command in Linux](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/disown-command-linux)

The `disown` command in Unix-like systems, such as Linux, is used to remove a job from the shell's job table,
effectively disassociating it from the shell. This is useful for keeping long-running background processes alive even
after you close the terminal session. Here's a tutorial explaining how to use it:

## What is `disown`?

When you run a command in the background using `&`, it becomes a background job. However, if you close your terminal,
the background job will be terminated because it is associated with the terminal session. The `disown` command allows
you to remove a job from the shell’s job table, preventing the job from being terminated when the terminal closes.

### Common Use Cases

- **Keep a process running after closing the terminal.**
- **Disassociate a process from the current shell session.**
- **Prevent a job from being affected by the `SIGHUP` signal when the terminal is closed.**

## disown Command Syntax

The basic syntax for the `disown` command is:

```bash
disown [options] jobID1 jobID2 ... jobIDN
```

### Steps to Use `disown`

#### 1. Start a background process

First, you need to run a command in the background. You can do this by appending `&` at the end of the command:

```bash
$ sleep 1000 &
[1] 12345
```

This command runs the `sleep 1000` command in the background and outputs a job number (`[1]`) and the process ID (`12345`).

#### 2. View the background jobs

To see a list of your current jobs, use the `jobs` command:

```bash
$ jobs -l
[1]+  12345  Running                 sleep 1000 &
```

#### 3. Disown the job

Now, if you want to disown this job (i.e., remove it from the shell’s job table), use the `disown` command with the job number:

```bash
$ disown %1
```

Here, `%1` refers to job number 1. After running this command, the job will no longer appear in the output of `jobs`,
and it won’t be terminated if you close the terminal.

#### 4. Verify the job is disowned

If you run `jobs` after disowning a job, you will not see it listed anymore:

```bash
$ jobs -l
```

The job is no longer in the job table, meaning it will continue running even if you close the terminal.

#### 5. Disown all jobs

If you want to disown all background jobs at once, use the following command:

```bash
$ disown -a
```

This will remove all jobs from the shell's job table.

> Using the `disown` command without any options or job IDs removes the last job on the job table.

### Advanced Usage

- **Prevent a job from receiving `SIGHUP`**: Normally, when you close a terminal, processes that are
tied to that session will receive a `SIGHUP` signal. By disowning a job, you prevent this signal from
being sent, ensuring that the job keeps running.
