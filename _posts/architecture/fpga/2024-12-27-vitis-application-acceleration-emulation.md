## Background

### Why Vitis Emulation Flow?

Programming actual FPGA hardware directly is time consuming and prone to fault.
If we successfully achieve the expected results through emulation, we can be confident that it will likely work on actual hardware.
Additionally, emulation targets provide full visibility into the application or accelerator, thus making it easier to perform debugging.
