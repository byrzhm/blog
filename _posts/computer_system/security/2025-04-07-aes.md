## What is AES?

**AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** is a symmetric block cipher standardized by NIST.
It encrypts data in **128-bit blocks** and supports **128, 192, or 256-bit keys**. AES
is widely used in various applications like VPNs, file encryption, messaging, and SSL/TLS.

## AES Modes of Operation

See [Modes](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/symmetric-encryption/#module-cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.modes).
